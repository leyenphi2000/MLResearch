## Clustering Boundaries of Topologically Associated Domains in Epigenetic Landscape

### Introduction

Chromosomes fold into domains with preferential intradomain interactions. These contact domains are referred to as topologically associating domains (TADs). Many studies focus on stratifying TADs in the spatial domain. However, there has been no study that aims to identify similar TADs in the epigenetic space. Our goal is to treat each TAD boundary as a point in the N-dimensional epigenetic space, where N is the number of types of epigenetic signals to be used. This project utilizes cluster analysis through machine learning algorithms to cluster TAD boundaries. Our results are then used to identify clusters or groups of TAD boundaries based on their epigenetic signals. This helps in the identification of TAD boundaries which are closely related functionally.
